This repository contains scripts for an analysis of 1) age and sex effects on multiple biomarkers in zoo-housed Western lowland gorillas and 2) how age, sex, and these biomarkers impact health outcomes. The associated manuscript can be found here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-021-00942-6. Given the nature of the data used in this analysis, raw data are not housed in this repository. Please contact the corresponding author, Dr. Ashely Edes, with questions on data access.
